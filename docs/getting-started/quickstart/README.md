This quickstart helps you with these basic tasks in the Snyk application:

{% hint style="info" %}
Before starting, check that the code in your repositories matches Snyk's [supported languages and frameworks](../../supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks/).
{% endhint %}

1. [Create a Snyk account](create-or-log-in-to-a-snyk-account.md).
2. [Set up a Snyk integration](set-up-an-integration.md) to give Snyk access to your code for scanning.
3. [Import a Project](import-a-project.md) to scan and identify issues.
4. [Review the results](view-snyk-scan-results.md) and take action to fix your issues.
