# Glossary

## A

### Advisor

See [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor/).

### **Asset (Snyk AppRisk)**

A Snyk AppRisk asset is an identifiable entity that is part of an application, and relevant for security and developers. Snyk is generally focused on the development stages of application software, secures repository assets containing software package assets, and builds artifacts like container image assets.

### Application (Snyk AppRisk)

An application is software that serves a business purpose and consists of assets that form the app. Organizations often define the scope of an application differently.

### Application Graph

Represents the mapping of security issues, application assets, relationships between assets, and all relevant contextual information.

## B

### Base image

The parent image used to construct a container image, usually defined in the `FROM` directive in a Dockerfile. Base images themselves can be constructed from other base images.

### Broker

See [Snyk Broker](../enterprise-configuration/snyk-broker/).

### Build System

A system that takes the source code and builds the deployable application (such as a container).

### Business context

Information related to the organization's objectives, priorities, and regulatory requirements, such as criticality of the application to the business, compliance standards, data sensitivity, and potential impact on revenue or reputation.

## C

### CI/CD

Continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and continuous deployment (CD) together comprise a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) model, guiding developers to automate the development and delivery of small, frequent changes. This ensures all team members have access to the latest codebase and can ensure the compatibility of committed code during development. See [Snyk CI/CD](../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-workflow-and-integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/) for details of Snyk CI/CD integrations.

### **Class (Snyk AppRisk)**

A way to assign business context to assets and categorize an asset based on the business criticality. Assets can be assigned Classes A, B, C, or D, where Class A (assets that are business critical, deal with sensitive data, are subject to compliance, and so on) is the most important, and Class D (test apps, sandbox environments, and so on) the least important. Assets are assigned Class C by default. A class can be used in policies as well as defined in a policy.

### CLI

Command Line Interface. See [Snyk CLI](glossary.md#snyk-cli).

### Cloud Native Application Security

Implementing security throughout the CI/CD pipeline, automating security embedding in microservices, and maximizing repetition to reduce the introduction of vulnerabilities. Snyk provides a comprehensive [CNAS platform](https://snyk.io/product/cloud-native-application-security/).\
See the article [Cloud-native security guide for building secure applications](https://snyk.io/learn/cloud-native-security-for-cloud-native-applications/).

### Code assets (Snyk AppRisk)

A hierarchical list of all assets retrieved from the scanned repositories.

### Container

Containers allow you to package applications and their dependencies together to be deployed as a single runnable unit. A container is an abstraction provided by the operating system kernel that allows a process to be isolated from other processes running on the system. See also [Snyk Container.](glossary.md#snyk-container)

### Container engine

For users, an application that takes a container image and turns it into a running container. Container engines typically interface with container registries and run containers. Examples of container engines include Docker, CRI-O, and LXC.

### Container image

One or more files that, when instantiated by a container engine or runtime, provide a running container. Images are the packaging and distribution format for containers.

### Container registry

A server that provides a mechanism to store and retrieve container images.

### **Controls (Snyk AppRisk)**

The security controls associated with the asset. Navigate to the Snyk AppRisk Controls section to see all available statuses for security controls.

### **Coverage (Snyk AppRisk)**

An assessment of whether applicable assets are scanned and tested by security tools (like Snyk Open Source, for instance), as it relates to an application security program. A type of policy that allows you to specify what controls should be applied and, optionally, how often it needs to be run.

### Coverage gap (Snyk AppRisk)

An assessment of all assets that fall "out of policy" and do not satisfy the coverage criteria you have specified, due to infrequent scanning or no scanning at all.

### CVE

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. A widely-used identifier for a well-known vulnerability.

### CVSS

Common Vulnerability Scoring System. An industry standard to assess the severity of vulnerabilities, using a score of 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Snyk uses CVSS.

### CWE

Common Weakness Enumeration. An online glossary that categorizes software and hardware weaknesses into different types, for example, CWE-20: Input Validation.

## D

### DAST

Dynamic Application Security Testing. An application that you can point at a site or service; it then typically profiles the site or service, then examines the output and behavior to uncover security vulnerabilities. See also [SAST](glossary.md#sast).

### Dependency

When your application uses another package, this other package becomes a dependency in your own software.

* A direct dependency is a package you include in your own Project.
* An indirect dependency (also known as a deep, chained, or transitive dependency), is a package that is used by one of your direct dependencies.

### Dependency tree

Also known as Dependency path. A hierarchical graph showing the dependencies of a software application. This includes both direct and indirect dependencies and thus may be many levels deep.

### Development context

Information and requirements surrounding the development of applications within an organization, such as ownership, development tools, environments, teams, workflows, and processes.

### DevOps

A set of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that combines software development and IT operations to shorten the systems development lifecycle.

### DevSecOps

The integration of security into emerging agile IT and DevOps development as seamlessly and as transparently as possible.

### Dockerfile
