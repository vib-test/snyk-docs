# Snyk Web UI

{% hint style="success" %}
If you have not done so already, [create an account](quickstart/create-or-log-in-to-a-snyk-account.md) with Snyk.
{% endhint %}

Use the Snyk Web UI to run Snyk from any [supported browser](quickstart/#supported-browsers).

The following Snyk functions are available with the Web UI:

* [Explore the Dashboard](snyk-web-ui.md#explore-the-dashboard)
* [View reports](snyk-web-ui.md#view-reports)
* [Manage your Projects](snyk-web-ui.md#manage-your-projects)
* [Manage your integrations](snyk-web-ui.md#manage-your-integrations)
* [Manage Organization or Group members](snyk-web-ui.md#manage-organization-or-group-members)
* [Set Snyk Organization and Group settings](snyk-web-ui.md#snyk-organization-or-group-settings)
* [View helpful resources](snyk-web-ui.md#view-helpful-resources)
* [Manage account preferences and settings](snyk-web-ui.md#manage-account-preferences-and-settings)

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also use Snyk functions from the [Snyk CLI](../snyk-cli/), [in your IDE](../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-workflow-and-integrations/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions/), and with the [Snyk API](../snyk-api/).
{% endhint %}

## Explore the Dashboard

When you log in to an existing account and select an Organization, the Web UI opens to the Dashboard for that Organization:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Snyk-dashboard.png" alt="Snyk Dashboard, the view when you log in and select an Organization"><figcaption><p>Snyk Dashboard, the view when you log in and select an Organization</p></figcaption></figure>

Use the Dashboard to see your top pending tasks and vulnerable Projects, and add new Projects.

### Top pending tasks

The **Pending tasks** section shows the next chores to be handled for the Projects in a Snyk Organization.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Pending-tasks.png" alt="Pending tasks on the dashboard"><figcaption><p>Pending tasks on the dashboard</p></figcaption></figure>

#### View Projects

Use the links for Projects on the Dashboard to explore and manage the metadata, retest, and fix options for the Target files in your Projects. Each link opens a Project details page where you can view the Project **Overview**, or switch to the **History** and **Settings** tabs.

See [Snyk Projects](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/) for more information.

#### Fix vulnerabilities

Snyk tracks and flags Pull Requests (PRs) in the top-most vulnerable projects, including:

* PRs that can be raised to fix vulnerabilities in some of the most vulnerable Projects.
* PRs that have already been raised by or through Snyk and are open and awaiting review.

For Projects with the **Fix vulnerabilities** link, use this link to view Project details with an option to open a fix PR. See [Snyk Fix Pull or Merge Requests](../scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/snyk-fix-pull-or-merge-requests/) for more details.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, Snyk tracks and flags PRs in GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and Bitbucket Cloud only, and only for the top-most vulnerable Projects. If you use another SCM, the **Pending tasks** section shows PRs that can be raised but not PRs that have already been raised.
{% endhint %}

### Top vulnerable projects

Similarly, the **Top vulnerable projects** section shows the [Snyk Projects](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/) assessed as the most vulnerable, with similar functions available as the **Pending tasks** section.

### Add project

Use the **Add project** link on the Dashboard to add [Snyk Projects](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/). Select how to add the Project from the dropdown. See [Import a Project](quickstart/import-a-project.md) for more details.

## **View reports**

You can view [reports](../manage-issues/reporting/) to gain visibility and insights into the state of all your Projects, vulnerabilities, and license issues. You will find detailed definitions for information in the reports in the tooltips in the Reporting user interface.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
Reporting is available for Enterprise plans. For more information, see [Plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/).
