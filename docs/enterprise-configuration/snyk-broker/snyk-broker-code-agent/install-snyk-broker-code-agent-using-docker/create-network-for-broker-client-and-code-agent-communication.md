# Create network for Broker client and Code Agent communication

To run Snyk Broker with the Code Agent, you must establish a network connection between them. To do this you can create a Docker bridge network as explained here.

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information on Docker bridge networks, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/).

To establish this network connection between the Broker Client and the Code Agent, you can also use other methods and tools, like Ngrok.
{% endhint %}

**To create a Docker bridge network** run:

```
docker network create <network_name>
```

where `network_name` is a name for the new network between the Broker Client and the Code Agent, for example:

```
docker network create mySnykBrokerNetwork
```

where `mySnykBrokerNetwork`is the name of the new network.

**To verify the network creation** run:

```
docker network ls
```

Your output is similar to the following:

```
NETWORK ID     NAME                  DRIVER    SCOPE
cb352a803eb0   mySnykBrokerNetwork   bridge    local
```
