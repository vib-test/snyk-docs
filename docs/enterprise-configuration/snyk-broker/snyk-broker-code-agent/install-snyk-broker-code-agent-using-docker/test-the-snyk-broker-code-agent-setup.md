# Test the Snyk Broker Code Agent setup

To test the Code Agent with Snyk Broker setup, import a repository to Snyk and verify that you receive the Code Analysis Project and results. When the selected repositories are imported to Snyk, and the Snyk Code results are displayed, the Code Agent with Snyk Broker setup is operating successfully.

To test the setup, follow these steps:

1\. On the Snyk Web UI, open the Organization where you want to test the Code Agent.

2\. When the required Organization is open, select **Add project**. Then select the SCM for which you set the Code Agent:

3\. On the **Personal and Organization repositories** page, select the repositories you want Snyk Code to analyze, and click the **Add selected repositories** button:

The selected repositories are imported to Snyk Code, and a progress bar appears on the **Projects** page. When the import is completed, a message appears on the **Projects** page confirming the success of the import. Your imported repositories appear as Target folders, each containing the **Code analysis** Project that includes the findings of the Snyk Code test:

4\. To view the Snyk Code results, select the **Code analysis** Project.

The **Code Analysis** page opens, displaying the list and details of the vulnerability issues that were discovered in the selected repository:

5\. To view the details of a vulnerability issue, select **Full details**.

The details of the issue appear, and depending on the way you set up the Broker client, the code snippets either appear in the **Data flow** tab or not:

This example shows Snyk Code results with code snippets.
