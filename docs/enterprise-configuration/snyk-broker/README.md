# Snyk Broker

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**

Snyk Broker is available only for Enterprise plans. For more information, see [Plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans).
{% endhint %}

Snyk Broker is an open-source tool that acts as a proxy between Snyk and special integrations, allowing for access by [snyk.io](http://snyk.io/) to your code to scan it and return results to you. SCM integrations with Broker support Snyk Open Source, Snyk Code, Snyk Container (Dockerfile), Snyk IaC. and Snyk AppRisk. For more information, see [How Snyk Broker works](./#how-snyk-broker-works).

## How to download and install Snyk Broker

Snyk Broker is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/snyk/broker) and published as a set of Docker images for specific integrations. If you are using Kubernetes, Snyk provides a [Helm Chart](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-broker-helm) to deploy Snyk Broker. To deploy Broker, you must install and configure an integration.

You can install and configure using [Helm](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/install-and-configure-broker-using-helm.md) or [Docker](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/install-and-configure-broker-using-docker.md). You can install using Docker to run the Snyk Broker Client or run `npm install snyk-broker`. Snyk recommends using Helm as the simplest way to deploy Snyk Broker.

## **Integrations with Snyk Broker**

Install each type of integration and configure using environment variables, as explained for [Docker](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/install-and-configure-broker-using-docker.md) and [Helm](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/install-and-configure-broker-using-helm.md).

Types of integrations supported with Broker are:

* Your Source Code Management (SCM) system ([GitHub](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/github-prerequisites-and-steps-to-install-and-configure-broker/), [GitHub Enterprise](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/github-enterprise-prerequisites-and-steps-to-install-and-configure-broker/), [BitBucket Server/Data Center](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/bitbucket-server-data-center-prerequisites-and-steps-to-install-and-configure-broker/), [GitLab](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/gitlab-prerequisites-and-steps-to-install-and-configure-broker/), [Azure Repos](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/azure-repos-prerequisites-and-steps-to-install-and-configure-broker/))
  * SCM that is not internet-reachable
  * Publicly-accessible SCM, allowing you to view and control Snyk activity for increased data security
* Your on-premise [Jira](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/jira-prerequisites-and-steps-to-install-and-configure-broker/), [JFrog Artifactory](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/artifactory-repository-install-and-configure-broker/), or [Nexus](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/nexus-repository-prerequisites-and-steps-to-install-and-configure-broker/) installation
* Network-restricted [container registries](snyk-broker-container-registry-agent/)
* [Infrastructure as code (IaC) configuration files](snyk-broker-infrastructure-as-code-detection/) on private Git-based repositories

You can also use [derived Docker images](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/snyk-broker/install-and-configure-broker-using-docker/snyk-broker-set-up-examples/derived-docker-images-for-broker-client-integrations-and-container-registry-agent) for each integration and the Container Registry Agent.

For information about advanced configuration as needed for your installation, see[ Advanced configuration for Snyk Broker Docker installation ](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/snyk-broker/install-and-configure-broker-using-docker/advanced-configuration-for-snyk-broker-docker-installation)and [Advanced setup for Helm Chart installation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/snyk-broker/install-and-configure-broker-using-helm/advanced-setup-for-helm-chart-installation).

## **Using Snyk Broker to scan your code**

To use Snyk Open Source with Snyk Broker, you need only the Broker Server and Broker Client components. The Broker Client is published as a set of Docker images, each configured for a specific Git service. Configure each type of integration using environment variables following the links in the section [Integrations with Snyk Broker](./#integrations-with-snyk-broker).

To scan other types of code with Snyk Broker, you must add a component or configurations and add parameters to the Broker Client setup:

* **Snyk Code** – Grant Broker access to perform a [Git clone of your repository](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/advanced-configuration-for-snyk-broker-docker-installation/snyk-code-clone-capability-with-broker-for-docker.md) by adding an environment variable: `ACCEPT_CODE=true.`
* **Snyk Container** – add the [Container Registry Agent](snyk-broker-container-registry-agent/) to enable the connection to network-restricted container registries and the analysis of container images. There are instructions for [installing with Docker](snyk-broker-container-registry-agent/) and [installing with Helm](snyk-broker-container-registry-agent/install-broker-for-container-registry-agent-using-helm.md).
* **Snyk Infrastructure as Code** – configure the [`accept.json` file with additional parameters](snyk-broker-infrastructure-as-code-detection/) to detect and analyze Terraform, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes configuration files through Snyk Broker.

## How Snyk Broker works

Snyk Broker is designed to connect Snyk products to self-hosted integrations that are not publicly accessible from the internet. Snyk Broker also allows you to do the following:

* Control Snyk access to your network by limiting the files to which Snyk has access and the actions that Snyk can perform.
* Manage a fixed private IP for your integration, targeting the Broker.

Snyk Broker includes a Server and a Client, basic components that are the same across all integrations. The Broker Server runs on the Snyk SaaS backend and is provided by Snyk; no installation is required. The Broker Client is a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/broker/) deployed in your infrastructure. For more information, see [Components of Snyk Broker](components-of-snyk-broker.md) and [Connections with Snyk Broker](connections-with-snyk-broker.md).

See [Prepare Snyk Broker for deployment](prepare-snyk-broker-for-deployment.md) for information about prerequisites, choosing components, network configuration, and credentials.
