Snyk reports provide the visibility and analytics needed to drive data-based conversations between development and security.

Security professionals can easily access, analyze, and share Snyk security data to track developer adoption and success, identify where the greatest amount of risk lies to prioritize remediation effectively, and understand the overall risk posture across the Organization's application portfolio.

Snyk Reports offer analytics across all of your Projects, displaying detailed and aggregated data about Projects and issues. Data displayed in each report is scoped to the Snyk Organization or Group in which you are working.

Snyk Reports are highly flexible, enabling you to display specifically selected data in the appropriate view to answer key security questions.
