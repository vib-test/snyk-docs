## Issues Detail report

The Issues Detail report displays all known issues in all of your Projects that are being monitored by Snyk. The report gives details about each issue and which of your Projects are affected and provides links to fix information.

The Issues Detail report displays the number of issues as well as the number of unique vulnerabilities that make up the issues.

Quick aggregations are available by categories including **Severity**, **Product Name**, and **Issue Type**:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/reporting-beta-quick-aggregation-issues-detail-report.png" alt="Quick aggregation for Issues Detail report"><figcaption><p>Quick aggregation for Issues Detail Report</p></figcaption></figure>

Individual issues are displayed in a table according to the selected category. You can modify columns as needed.

For a table of only the unique vulnerabilities, use Change Report to switch to the Vulnerabilities Detail report.

## Issues Summary report

The Issues Summary report highlights the value that Snyk is providing by enabling both the identification and resolution of issues.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/issues-summary-report.png" alt="Issues Summary report"><figcaption><p>Issues Summary report</p></figcaption></figure></div>

The report provides a glimpse into how well teams are optimizing the use of the Snyk platform for their workflow and provides a means to measure and improve security.

This report enables you to easily understand the current state and trends of the highest security risk items. This report also provides a quick view into where risk is coming from and where remediation efforts are most and least effective.

Use the date filter in the upper right corner of the Issues Summary report to see key metrics and charts for a specified interval.

This report shows a number of key metrics associated with issues in that interval with a comparison to the same metrics in the previous period so you can get a quick understanding of trends. See tooltips in the app for definitions of the metrics.

Scroll down for additional charts that show trend information in greater detail.

Key metrics are then broken down to point out information at the Organization or Project level. You can drill down to see what new and resolved issues were introduced during the date range selected.

## Vulnerabilities Detail report

The Vulnerabilities Detail report is similar to the Issues Detail report but shows issues grouped by Snyk Problem ID ([see Snyk Vulnerability DB](https://security.snyk.io/vuln)).

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/vuln-details-report.png" alt="Vulnerability Details report"><figcaption><p>Vulnerability Details report</p></figcaption></figure></div>

You can easily see how many instances of a vulnerability exist and how many Projects are affected. Use this report to understand which vulnerabilities are most prevalent for both resolution and prevention use cases.

For a table of Total Issues, use Change Reports to switch to the Issues Detail report.

## Featured Zero-Day report

This report addresses primary scenarios for managing and resolving emerging zero-day vulnerabilities, which carry significant consequences and attract substantial attention in the global AppSec community.

Use this report to discover your exposure to issues highlighted in a zero-day publication across various Targets and Projects. The report helps you prioritize zero-day issues and monitor the progress of remediation efforts against any remaining occurrences.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Zero-day report.png" alt="Featured Zero-Day Report"><figcaption><p>Featured Zero-Day Report</p></figcaption></figure>

The [Security team at Snyk](https://snyk.io/platform/security-intelligence/) continuously updates the [Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/) with new vulnerabilities several times a day. When the team discovers a major new zero-day vulnerability—typically in a widely used package with high severity that affects many customers—it will be announced and addressed as a zero-day event.

Upon the announcement of a new zero-day event, begin by examining the **Impacted Targets** table to gain a deeper understanding of the exposure. Use filters such as Project Lifecycle, Environment, or Project Criticality to focus solely on Targets associated with Projects in production that are externally exposed or of high criticality. Gaining such insights depends on the [availability of Project attributes](../../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/project-attributes.md#available-attributes-and-their-values).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (427).png" alt="Impacted Targets table"><figcaption><p>Impacted Targets table</p></figcaption></figure>

Next, proceed to the **All** **Issues** table and compile a prioritized list of issues requiring remediation. Typically, prioritization is determined by either the Snyk [Risk Score](../../manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing/risk-score.md) or NVD CVSS Score, with emphasis placed on addressing vulnerabilities within sensitive targets. Apply filters based on Project Lifecycle, Environment, or Project Criticality to identify and address these targets promptly.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (428).png" alt="All Issues table"><figcaption><p>All Issues table</p></figcaption></figure>

For continuous monitoring of remediation progress and efficacy, refer to the trend diagrams.\
The **Accumulative Issues Backlog Trend** diagram shows the weekly changes in the zero-day backlog by accumulating the weekly delta between identified and resolved issues. Use this diagram to ensure that your R\&D teams are reducing the zero-day backlog consistently, which will be indicated by a negative trend line.

In parallel, review the **Issues Identified versus Resolved over Time** diagram to conclude whether additional emphasis should be placed on preventing the introduction of new issues or on accelerating the remediation efforts.

## SLA Management report

The SLA (Service Level Agreement) Management report provides new levels of visibility into your SLA governance and compliance across Snyk Groups, Organizations, and Targets. It provides the means to assess the remediation time against SLA targets and prioritize the next steps to achieve the desired results.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/01-SlLAManagementReport (1).png" alt="SLA Management report"><figcaption><p>SLA Management report</p></figcaption></figure>

The report presents the SLA targets with default values based on common security standards, for example, FedRAMP. Within the report, users can modify each SLA target according to their security requirements.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/02-EditableSLATargets.png" alt="Editable SLA targets"><figcaption><p>Editable SLA targets</p></figcaption></figure>

Users can share the report with predefined SLA targets by sharing the URL of the report. Users can also return to a predefined SLA report by bookmarking the web page in their browser.

In the open issues section, the SLA severity breakdown shows a distribution of severity levels by the SLA compliance status of the viewed Group or Organization. The SLA trend indicates whether the viewed Group or Organization meets the expected progress toward SLA compliance.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/03OpenIssuesDetails.png" alt="Open issues section"><figcaption><p>Open issues section</p></figcaption></figure>

The SLA breakdown table allows you to compare the SLA compliance results of Organizations in the Group view, or Targets in the Organization view. The table is sorted by default according to the quantity of breached issues. Use the filters to view counters for specific severities only.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/04SLABreakdowntable.png" alt="SLA breakdown table"><figcaption><p>SLA breakdown table</p></figcaption></figure>

The breached and at-risk open issues table helps you prioritize issues based on their aging and SLA compliance status.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/05BreachedAndAtRiskOpenIssuesTable.png" alt="Breached issues table"><figcaption><p>Breached issues table</p></figcaption></figure>

You can also review the SLA results for resolved issues and perform a retrospective analysis.
