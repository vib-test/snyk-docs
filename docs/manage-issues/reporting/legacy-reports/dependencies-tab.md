# Legacy Reports Dependencies tab

The **Dependencies** tab acts as a Bill Of Materials (BOM) for all the direct dependencies in all of the Projects in the selected Organization. This allows you to quickly and easily identify which Projects have a specific version of a dependency.

Dependencies information is available from the **Dependencies** menu option - see [View dependencies](../../../manage-risk/reporting/dependencies-and-licenses/view-dependencies.md) for more details.

For systems using legacy reporting, this information is available from the **Reports** menu option.
