# Detect vulnerable base images from your Dockerfile

{% hint style="info" %}
You can add a single Dockerfile to each image that you have imported.
{% endhint %}

## **Prerequisites for adding a Dockerfile**

To receive base image fix advice, including major, minor, and alternative upgrades, as well as advice when you need to rebuild your image, ensure you:

* Have configured your preferred Git repository
* Have imported the repository that contains the relevant Dockerfile.

## **Add a Dockerfile**

To add a Dockerfile for additional fix advice:

1. In the **Projects** tab, find your Project by using a filter and navigate to the Project page.
2. On the Project page, navigate to **Settings**.
3. On the **Settings** page, under **Dockerfile**, click **Configure Dockerfile** and select the relevant Git repository from the dropdown.

4. On the page listing the available repositories, select the relevant repository which contains your Dockerfile.
5. Under **Path to your Dockerfile**, add the relative path to your Dockerfile, in the following format: /path/dockerfile.

6. Click **Update your Dockerfile**.

Snyk scans the Project again and provides relevant base image fix advice. You can see the fix advice on the Project page, under **Recommendations for upgrading the base image.**

The following information is displayed: **Current image**, **Minor upgrades**, **Major Upgrades**, **Alternative upgrades**, the number of vulnerabilities for each, and a severity ranking.

## Scan the base image from a Dockerfile

Snyk detects vulnerable base images by scanning your Dockerfile when you import a Git repository. This allows you to examine security issues before building the image and thus helps solve potential problems before they land in your registry or in production.

{% hint style="info" %}
When scanning Dockerfiles, Snyk can provide vulnerability information and base image recommendations for supported base images. If you need help, contact [Snyk Support](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us).
{% endhint %}

After you [integrate your Git repository with Snyk](../../../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-workflow-and-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/), any Dockerfiles in that repository are automatically identified and shown in the Web UI as Projects.
