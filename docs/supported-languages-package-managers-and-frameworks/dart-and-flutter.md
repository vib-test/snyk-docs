Snyk supports testing of Dart and Flutter packages from the Pub package manager using the `GET /orgs/{org_id}/packages/{purl}/issues endpoint,` [List issues for a package.](../snyk-api/how-to-use-snyk-api-endpoints/rest-api-list-issues-for-a-package.md) The endpoint returns known vulnerabilities for the package.

The following summarizes support for Dart and Flutter:

**Package manager**: Pub

**Package registry**: [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/)

**Test your app's packages**: Available, `pkg:pub`
