# Dep Graph API

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
The Snyk API is available with Enterprise plans. See [plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/) for details.

The Dep Graph API requires additional permissions. [Contact Snyk Support](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) to request access.
{% endhint %}

The recommended approach to testing and monitoring your dependencies managed by [Bazel](./) is to use the [Snyk Dep Graph](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/test/dep-graph) APIs. This API reference documentation includes the endpoints [Test Dep Graph](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/test/dep-graph/test-dep-graph) and [Monitor Dep Graph](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/monitor/monitor-dep-graph) and **a list of the supported package managers**.

The monitor capability allows customers to submit a tree for Snyk to monitor for vulnerabilities.

While you can use Bazel for many languages including C++, **the Dep Graph endpoints do not support C++**.

Follow these basic steps:

1. For each type of dependency (for example, Maven, Cocoapods), create a [Dep Graph JSON object](https://github.com/snyk/dep-graph) listing all the dependency packages and versions. For an example, see [Example of Snyk for Baszel](examples-of-snyk-for-bazel.md).
2.  As part of a Bazel test rule, send the Dep Braph JSON object as a POST request to the [Dep Graph Test API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/test/dep-graph), along with your [auth token](../../snyk-api/rest-api/authentication-for-api/). An example curl request follows:

    ```
    curl -X POST 'https://snyk.io/api/v1/test/dep-graph' \
      -H 'Authorization: token {{your token}}' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
      -d @dep-graph.json
    ```
3. Check the API response for pass/fail status and any resulting vulnerabilities.

## How the Test Dep Graph API works

The Snyk Dep Graph Test API takes a generic dependency graph and returns a report containing any relevant vulnerabilities for those dependencies.

The supported package managers and repository ecosystems are listed in the [API documentation](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/test/dep-graph) (`deb`, `gomodules`, `gradle`, `maven`, `npm`, `nuget`, `paket`, `pip`, `rpm`, `rubygems`, and `cocoapods`).

Any of your Bazel dependencies that are available in these ecosystems can be tested using the Snyk API.

## Snyk Dep Graph JSON syntax

The Dep Graph Test API takes a [Snyk Dep Graph](https://github.com/snyk/dep-graph) JSON object describing the root application and the graph of direct and transitive dependencies.

The [schema](https://github.com/snyk/dep-graph#depgraphdata) for this format is as follows:

```
export interface DepGraphData {
  schemaVersion: string;
  pkgManager: {
    name: string;
    version?: string;
    repositories?: Array<{
      alias: string;
    }>;
  };
  pkgs: Array<{
    id: string;
    info: {
      name: string;
      version?: string;
    };
  }>;
  graph: {
    rootNodeId: string;
    nodes: Array<{
      nodeId: string;
      pkgId: string;
      info?: {
        versionProvenance?: {
          type: string;
          location: string;
          property?: {
            name: string;
          };
        },
        labels?: {
          [key: string]: string | undefined;
        };
      };
      deps: Array<{
        nodeId: string;
      }>;
    }>;
  };
}
```

Further notes on specific components in the Dep Graph object follow:

* `schemaVersion` - the version of the Dep Graph schema. Set this to `1.2.0`.
* `pkgManager.name` - can be one of `deb`, `gomodules`, `gradle`, `maven`, `npm`, `nuget`, `paket`, `pip`, `rpm`, `rubygems`, or `cocoapods`.
* `pkgs` - an array of objects containing `id`, `name`and`version` of all packages in the Dep Graph. Note that the `id` must be in the form `name@version`. List each of your dependencies in this array, including an item representing the Project itself.
* `graph.nodes` - an array of objects describing the relationships between entries in `pkgs`. This is typically the Project node with all other packages defined as a flat array of direct dependencies in `deps.`
* `graph.rootNodeId` - specifies the `id` of the entry in `graph.nodes` to use as the root node of the graph. Set this to the `nodeId` of the Project node.

## Snyk Dep Graph Test API response

The Dep Graph Test API returns a JSON object describing any issues (vulnerabilities and licenses) found in the Dep Graph dependencies.

Further notes on specific components in the response object follow:

* `ok` - Boolean value summarizing whether Snyk found any vulnerabilities in the supplied dependencies. You can use this for a quick pass or fail test.
* `issuesData` - a hash of each unique vulnerability found. Each vulnerability contains many useful properties, such as `title`, `description`, `identifiers`, `publicationTime`, `severity`, and so on.
* `issues` - a simple array of mappings from vulnerabilities in `issuesData` to package. As a vulnerability may be relevant to multiple packages, this mapping is used to keep the response length as short as possible.
