Snyk does not support PackageReference without a version attribute. If your Project lacks this, Snyk may fail to open a PR for your Project.\
\
The current workaround is to add versions to all PackageReferences.

## Snyk support for the Nuget package manager

The **project.assets.json** file is required for scanning. Project files can be combined with [lock files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#locking-dependencies) for a more deterministic **project.assets.json** resolution.

Examples of supported Project files that resolve into **project.assets.json** include:

* **\*.csproj**
* **\*.vbproj**
* **\*.fsproj**

If needed, restore dependencies in the .NET project by running `dotnet restore` and ensure that **obj/project.assets.json** was created by the previous command. Then run `snyk test`.

## Snyk CLI and Snyk for .NET

For information about the `snyk test` options for use with NuGet, see [Options for NuGet projects in the Test help](../../snyk-cli/commands/test.md#options-for-nuget-projects). For the `snyk monitor` options, see [Options for NuGet projects in the Monitor help](../../snyk-cli/commands/monitor.md#options-for-nuget-projects).

To use Paket with the Snyk CLI, be sure a **paket.lock** file is present in combination with a **paket.dependencies** file. Then run `snyk test`.

## Git repositories and Snyk for .NET

Import .NET Projects from any of the Git services Snyk supports.

When your Projects have been imported, Snyk analyzes your Projects based on their supported manifest files and then builds the dependency tree and displays it in the Snyk Web UI, similar to the following:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/dotNet Project.png" alt=".NET dependency tree in Snyk Web UI"><figcaption><p>.NET dependency tree in Snyk Web UI</p></figcaption></figure>

Using the Snyk Web UI, you can configure Snyk to scan your entire Project, including the build dependencies, or skip the build dependencies.

You can also **update your language preferences.**

1. Log in to your account and navigate to the relevant Group and Organization you want to manage.
2. Navigate to **Settings** and select settings for **.NET**.
3. To scan all development dependencies, be sure that **Scan build dependencies** are checked.

After you select a NuGet project for import, Snyk builds the dependency tree based on these manifest files:

* For .NET Core, the **\*.proj** files
* For .NET Framework, the **\*.proj** file, and **packages.config**

Examples of supported Project files include:

* **\*.csproj**
* \***.vbproj**
* **\*.fsproj**

A .NET Project can target multiple target frameworks. Snyk creates a separate dependency tree for each target framework, displaying each as a separate Snyk Project from the interface. This makes it easier to understand why a dependency is being used and also to assess the fix strategy.

Snyk does not support Project import for Paket.

## Dependencies managed by packages.config

While there are two approaches for dependencies managed by **packages.config**., the following is the recommended approach because it will yield the most accurate results:

First, install the dependencies into the **packages** folder by running `nuget install -OutputDirectory packages` and make sure the **packages** directory has been created by the previous command. Then run `snyk test`.

Examples of supported project files that resolve into **packages** include: **packages.config**

{% hint style="info" %}
While you should also be able to run `snyk test` without previously installing dependencies this will result in less accurate vulnerability results.
{% endhint %}

#### **CLI options for use with** other dependencies

Other support includes **project.json** (no longer recommended, refer to [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/archive/project-json)).

To build the dependency tree, Snyk analyzes the **paket.dependencies** and **paket.lock** files.

## Fixing vulnerabilities for .NET

For a general understanding of how Snyk helps you fix Open Source vulnerabilities within your Projects, see [Fix your vulnerabilities](../../scan-with-snyk/snyk-open-source/manage-vulnerabilities/fix-your-vulnerabilities.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
The Fix PR feature is available only for Snyk SCM integrations.

If you are currently managing your Project dependencies with NuGet and using [`PackageReference`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files) or [`packages.config`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/packages-config), Snyk can automatically update the dependency version in your manifest file, provided there is an actual fix for it. You can then review and merge your fixes.
