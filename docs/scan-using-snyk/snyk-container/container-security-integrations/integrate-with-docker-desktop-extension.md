# Integrate with Docker Desktop Extension

Docker Desktop is a GUI that simplifies the management of containers and containerized applications. You can use it with Mac, Windows, or Linux.

Snyk has a Docker Desktop extension that allows developers and platform teams to scan container images for vulnerabilities within the Docker Desktop interface.

To install and run the Snyk Docker Desktop Extension:

1.  On the Docker Desktop home screen, click the three dots next to **Extensions**, and select **Marketplace**.\\
