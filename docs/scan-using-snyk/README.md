# Scan with Snyk

You can use Snyk to scan and secure your codebase and cloud infrastructure configurations, taking advantage of the Snyk capabilities in Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Software Composition Analysis (SCA), and Infrastructure as Code analysis.

For more information, see [Scanning overview](../scan-with-snyk/scanning-overview/) and [Start scanning](../scan-with-snyk/start-scanning-using-the-cli-web-ui-or-api.md).

## Select scanning methods

Snyk supports scanning methods that correspond to Snyk products. Choose the right scanning method for the job you want to do, to find and fix issues early in the Software Development Life Cycle.

* [Snyk Open Source](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-open-source/): scan your open-source libraries for vulnerabilities and license issues.\
  More information: [Open Source Security Explained](https://snyk.io/series/open-source-security/).
* [Snyk Code](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-code/): scan your code for security vulnerabilities using source code analysis.\
  More information: [Exploring the advanced technologies behind Snyk Code](https://snyk.io/blog/advanced-technologies-behind-snyk-code/).
* [Snyk Container](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/): scan for container image and workload vulnerabilities.
* [Snyk Infrastructure as Code: ](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/)scan for issues in your cloud infrastructure configurations, before and after deployment.

## Run pull request checks

Scan and automatically address potential vulnerabilities when you review pull requests (PRs), to prevent security issues in production, for your open-source libraries and your own code.

Snyk can also retest and alert on the default branch on a scheduled basis and show results.
