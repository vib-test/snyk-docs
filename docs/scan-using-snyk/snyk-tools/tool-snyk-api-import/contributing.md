# Contributing to snyk-api-import

## Contributor Agreement

A pull-request will only be considered for merging into the upstream codebase after you have signed Snyk's contributor agreement, assigning to Snyk the rights to the contributed code and granting you a license to use it in return. If you submit a pull request, you will be prompted to review and sign the agreement with one click (Snyk uses [CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/)).

## Pull requests

### Commit messages

Commit messages must follow the [Angular-style](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format) commit format (but excluding the scope):

```
fix: minified scripts being removed

Also includes tests
```

This allows for the automatic change log to generate correctly.

**Commit types** must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons and other similar changes)
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance

To release a major update you must add `BREAKING CHANGE:` to the start of the body and the detail of the breaking change.

### Code standards

Ensure that your code adheres to the included `.eslintrc` config by running `npm run lint`.

### Sending pull requests

* New command line options are generally discouraged unless there's a _really_ good reason.
* Add tests for newly added code (and try to mirror directory and file structure if possible).
* Spell check.
* PRs will not be code reviewed unless all tests are passing.

**Important:** When fixing a bug, commit a **failing test** first so that CircleCI (or the approver) can show the code failing. Once that commit is in place, then commit the bug fix so that Snyk can test _before_ and _after_.

Remember that you're developing for multiple platforms and versions of Node.js, so if the tests pass on your Mac or Linux or Windows machine, the tests _may_ not pass elsewhere.
