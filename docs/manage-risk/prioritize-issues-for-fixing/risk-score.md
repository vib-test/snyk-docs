# Risk Score

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Release status**

Risk Score is currently in [Early Access](../../getting-started/snyk-release-process.md) for Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container. Use [Snyk Preview](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/manage-settings/snyk-preview) to replace the Priority Score with the new Risk Score for Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container issues.
{% endhint %}

The Snyk Risk Score is a single value assigned to an issue, applied by automatic risk analysis for all vulnerability-type issues. License issues are not currently supported. Risk Score is based on the potential impact and likelihood of exploitability. Ranging from 0 to 1,000, the score represents the risk imposed on your environment and enables a risk-based prioritization approach.

Risk score remains the same over time if the contributing factors do not change. However, some contributing factors, such as Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), potentially can change frequently. The number of days since the vulnerability was first published is also a factor and causes the score to change once, when the number of days becomes more than one year and the likelihood subscore decreases.

Since real risk is scarce, you should expect a significant drift in the distribution of scores, as can be seen in this example of Project score distributions:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="Example Project scores distribution"><figcaption><p>Example Project scores distribution</p></figcaption></figure>

Risk Score replaces the Priority Score directly. See the [priority score docs](priority-score.md) for how to interact with the Risk Score in the UI, API, and Reports, where the Risk Score is now introduced when enabled.

Risk Score is not available in the CLI.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Risk Score replaces the Priority Score only after the Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container Projects are re-tested.

You can wait for the Projects to be automatically re-tested (daily for Snyk Open Source and weekly for Snyk Container), or you can manually re-test the Project.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that in the API, the relevant fields are still named with `priority.`When Risk Score is enabled, the scores and factors populated in these fields are based on the Risk Score model as part of the early access stage.
{% endhint %}

## Explore the Risk Score by issue

When looking at Issue card information, hover over the score to see the type of score (Priority or Risk Score) that is being displayed. The Risk Score tooltip provides information about the subscore and the Risk Factors contributing to the score.

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (118) (2).png" alt="Risk Score tooltip" width="563"><figcaption><p>Risk Score tooltip showing Impact and Likelihood</p></figcaption></figure></div>

## About the Risk Score model

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/matrix (2).png" alt="he Snyk Risk Score Model"><figcaption><p>The Snyk Risk Score Model</p></figcaption></figure>

The model that powers the Risk Score applies automatic risk analysis for each security issue based on the potential impact and likelihood of exploitability.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Risk model results from extensive research conducted by the Snyk Security Data Science team and experienced security researchers. The model draws on expertise gained over the years in developing the [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/).
{% endhint %}

### Impact subscore

Objective impact factors are the CVSS impact metrics, Availability, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Scope, calculated based on the CVSS impact subscore. For Container issues, Provider Urgency is also taken into account.

The business criticality Project attribute will be taken into account as a contextual impact factor, increasing or decreasing the impact subscore. For more information, see [Project attributes](../../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/project-attributes.md).

### Likelihood subscore

Objective likelihood factors are taken into account:

* Exploit Maturity
* Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)
* Age of advisory
* CVSS exploitability metrics: Attack vector, Privileges required, User interaction, and Scope
* Social Trends
* Malicious Package
* Provider Urgency (Snyk Container)
* Package popularity (Snyk Open Source)
* (Forthcoming) Disputed vulnerability

Contextual likelihood factors then increase or decrease the likelihood subscore:

* Reachability (Snyk Open Source Java only, JavaScript to be supported)
* Transitive depth
* (Forthcoming) Insights such as `Deployed` , `OS condition` and `Public Facing`

{% hint style="info" %}
Fixability is no longer considered part of the Score Calculation, as the effort needed to mitigate a security issue does not affect the risk it imposes. To focus on actionable issues, use Fixability filters and then use the Risk Score to start with the riskiest issues.
{% endhint %}

{% endhint %}

### Contextual likelihood risk factors

#### Transitive depth

Building on [past studies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07972.pdf), Snyk research has shown that if a vulnerability is introduced to a Project transitively rather than directly, it is less likely that an exploitable function path will exist.

| Possible input values                   | Score impact                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Direct dependency`                     | Likelihood subscore does not change.                       |
| `Indirect dependency`                   | Likelihood subscore decreases.                             |
| `Great transitive depth`_(forthcoming)_ | Likelihood subscore decreases significantly (coming soon). |

#### Reachability

Snyk static code analysis determines whether the vulnerable method is being called. This is currently supported only in Java; JavaScript support is coming soon. For more information, see [Reachable vulnerabilities](reachable-vulnerabilities.md).\
When Reachability is not enabled, the Likelihood subscore will not change, and the factor will not show up.

| Possible input values | Score impact                                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Reachable`           | Likelihood subscore increases, and transitive depth is not considered. |
| `No path found`       | Likelihood subscore does not change.                                   |

#### OS condition (forthcoming)

Whether or not the operating system and architecture of a given resource are relevant to this specific issue

| Possible input values | Score impact                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Condition met`       | Likelihood subscore does not change.         |
| `Condition not met`   | Likelihood subscore decreases significantly. |
| `No data`             | Likelihood subscore does not change.         |

#### Deployed (forthcoming)

Whether or not the container image introducing this issue is deployed.

| Possible input values | Score impact                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Deployed`            | Likelihood subscore increases.       |
| `Not Deployed`        | Likelihood subscore decreases.       |
| `No data`             | Likelihood subscore does not change. |

#### Public facing (forthcoming)

Whether or not the asset introducing this issue is exposed to the Internet.

| Possible input values | Score impact                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Public Facing`       | Likelihood subscore increases.       |
| `Not Public Facing`   | Likelihood subscore decreases.       |
| `No data`             | Likelihood subscore does not change. |
