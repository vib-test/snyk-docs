# Set up Insights: User permissions

{% hint style="info" %}
The Set up Insights option is available only to Snyk AppRisk Pro users.
{% endhint %}

Currently, Snyk AppRisk is available at the Group level, so [grant relevant users the Group viewer or the Organization Collaborator role](../../../snyk-admin/manage-permissions-and-roles/user-role-management.md#manage-roles). This is the minimum required permission, but Group Admins can also view Prioritization.

After you have the right permission, you will see a new **Issues UI** option in the left navigation at the Group level. On the Issues page, you can also see two tabs, one for viewing and customizing your **Issues**, and one to **Set up Insights**.
