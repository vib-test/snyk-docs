# Inventory capabilities

Each inventory layout is presented in a table format, detailing the available key attributes:

* [Assets](inventory-capabilities.md#asset)
* [Issues](inventory-capabilities.md#issues)
* [Coverage Controls](inventory-capabilities.md#coverage-controls)
* [Tags](inventory-capabilities.md#tags)
* [Developers](inventory-capabilities.md#developers)
* [Class](inventory-capabilities.md#class)
* [Source](inventory-capabilities.md#source)
* [SCM Repository freshness](inventory-capabilities.md#repository-freshness)

## **Asset**

An asset in Snyk AppRisk represents a component in the software development lifecycle that may pose a risk. The following asset types are currently available:

* Repository assets [**`Billable`**](../how-does-snyk-count-assets.md#billable-assets)
* Container images [**`Billable`**](../how-does-snyk-count-assets.md#billable-assets)
* Packages
* Scanned artifacts

An asset can be the parent of multiple items. For example, a repository asset usually contains one or more package assets.

The Asset column incorporates the name of the repository asset, package, scanned artifact, or container images. Click on the arrow next to the parent asset name to expand the list of all contained items.

You can copy the name of an asset or browse the repository. Each asset has a menu at the end of the row. Click the menu, then select **Copy** to copy the URL or **Browse** to navigate to the asset repository.

### Repository assets

Repository assets represent SCM repositories. A repository asset is created by discovering the repositories directly in the SCM, when such integration is configured. Alternatively, a repository asset can be created by scanning a repository, (by Snyk or third-party tools) as long as the scanned code is identified with a specific repository (in Snyk, this means filling in the `gitRemoteURL` parameter).

If you scan the code locally using CLI, with no association to a repository, then a repository asset will not be created.

### Container Image assets

You can identify a container image based on the Image ID. If multiple container images have the same Image ID, then only one image asset is generated for that Image ID, enriched with information from all the identified container images for that ID.

Snyk AppRisk retrieves all image assets from Snyk Container. Reimport the images to ensure you scan the latest image. If you run a new scan on a Project that contains image assets, it rescans the same image for new vulnerabilities. To identify new image assets, you need to first reimport, and then scan the Project. Check the [Detect application vulnerabilities in container images](../../../scan-using-snyk/snyk-container/use-snyk-container/detect-application-vulnerabilities-in-container-images.md) page for more details.

### Packages

Packages in Snyk AppRisk are defined as software or libraries that are managed by package management systems.

Package assets are created when you scan the dependencies of a Project through package management systems or by using the Snyk CLI. This enables Snyk AppRisk to identify and analyze the security vulnerabilities of the packages used within a Project, offering insights into possible risk exposures and providing recommendations for mitigation.

### Scanned artifacts

A scanned artifact in Snyk AppRisk is an entity detected by Snyk that cannot be identified as a repository asset because it does not include identifying information, such as a Git remote URL.

Scanned artifacts provide users with visibility into what Snyk AppRisk detects from scans but require additional troubleshooting.

You can find scanned artifacts in the Inventory Type view, but they are not supported by Policies. Scanned artifacts may include duplicates due to missing identifying information.

## Asset tabs

The asset information is divided into the following tabs:

* **Summary** - a concentrated view of the asset properties. The Summary screen presents you with the following information:
  * Asset Info
    * Class - specifies the business criticality of the asset.
    * Source - specifies the origin of the asset.
    * Risk factors - provides the list of active risk factors.
    * SCM Repository freshness - provides the current status of your repositories, including the date of the last commit.
  * Issues Info - categorizes the identified types of open issues.
  * App Context - asset metadata from App Context integrations, such as Backstage catalog or ServiceNow CMDB, can include the following attributes: catalog name, category, application, owner, and so on.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (442) (1).png" alt="Snyk AppRisk Inventory - Assets Summary view"><figcaption><p>Snyk AppRisk Inventory - Assets Summary view</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Attributes** - miscellaneous attributes, like the Asset ID or Asset Type, that are fetched from the data source, but do not have a dedicated column. The benefit of having this info is not only by presenting it but mostly by making it searchable. You can search for an attribute by either using the inventory search bar or the filters.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Asset Attributes with Issues.png" alt="AppRisk - Assets Attributes window"><figcaption><p>Snyk AppRisk - Assets Attributes window</p></figcaption></figure>

## Issues

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Issues column is available in a Closed Beta state and is applicable only for the Snyk AppRisk Pro version. Please contact your salesperson if you are interested in Snyk AppRisk Pro.
{% endhint %}

The Issues column is designed to present a comprehensive list of issues that have been identified within your assets. These findings are the result of scans performed by Snyk as well as internal tools you may have deployed. This detailed list not only helps in understanding the security posture of your assets but also in prioritizing remediation efforts based on the severity and impact of each issue. By having visibility into these issues, you can take proactive steps toward improving the overall security of your applications and infrastructure.

Most of the issues are mapped to an asset. However, some of the issues are associated with an asset but not directly linked to it. This is the case with image assets.

You can see these assets under the **Inventory** view, and they will also be reflected under the **Asset and Source Code** column from the **Insights UI** view.

The **Issues** column from the Asset view is designed to present an aggregated count of open issues. These counts are carefully categorized based on the severity level of the issues found in assets, their children's assets, or associated packages. The severity is divided into four distinct levels:

* **C** (Critical): Issues that represent a serious threat and should be addressed immediately to prevent potential exploits or major disruptions.
* **H** (High): These are significant issues that, while not immediately dangerous, could potentially lead to critical vulnerabilities if not resolved in a timely manner.
* **M** (Medium): Issues of medium severity might not pose an immediate threat but are still important to fix as part of regular maintenance to improve overall security and functionality.
* **L** (Low): These are considered minor issues that have a low impact on the security of the system and operation but should still be addressed to maintain optimal performance and prevent future vulnerabilities.

This classification streamlines prioritization, helping you focus on critical areas and optimize remediation.

## **Coverage Controls**

The Controls column displays all of the Snyk products that were executed on a specific repository asset. This column displays, in circles, a logo for each Snyk product. The logo icon itself has an indication of the highest severity of issues from this source. For example, if the highest severity issue is **C** (critical), you can see a red dot on the control icon.

The Controls logos can have one of the following states:

| Logo                                                                                   | Description                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (5) (1).png" alt="" data-size="original"> | The Snyk product was executed.                                                   |
| <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (7) (1).png" alt="" data-size="original"> | The Snyk product was executed but with issues.                                   |
| <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (3) (1).png" alt="" data-size="original"> | The Snyk product should have been executed but was not executed.                 |
| <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (6) (1).png" alt="" data-size="original"> | The Snyk product was executed and failed.                                        |
| <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (4).png" alt="" data-size="original">     | The Snyk product was executed and failed with issues.                            |
| <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (3).png" alt="" data-size="original">     | The Snyk product was executed and failed due to not being covered by the policy. |

Click a Controls logo to see **Last test** details and the **Issues** count, split by severity. This reflects the most recent time that the asset was scanned by a specific product.

## **Tags**

A repository asset tag can be added through Policies or be system-generated by Snyk AppRisk to provide more context. Click on a tags field to view all tags.

{% hint style="info" %}
BitBucket cannot automatically detect the language used in the source code from the repositories. In Snyk AppRisk you can only see the language tags that have been manually added for BitBucket. For more information, you can refer to the official documentation provided by BitBucket.
{% endhint %}

A system-generated tag includes the following information:

* **Technology** - the languages detected by Snyk AppRisk in the source code within a repository asset.
* **SCM Topic** - the topics found in the integrated SCM repositories. Snyk AppRisk currently supports topics from GitHub and GitLab.
* **Asset type tag** - the tag explaining the type of the asset. For example, the container assets will be assigned an image asset tag.
* **SCM Repository freshness** - the status of the repository and the date of the last commit.
  * **Active**: Had commits in the last 3 months.
  * **Inactive**: The last commits were made in the last 3 - 6 months.
  * **Dormant**: No commits in the last 6 months.

### Tag rules overview

System tags are automatically generated from the SCM repositories. System tags can be classified into three main categories:

* Languages:
  * This applies to GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, and BitBucket as long the data is available in the repository.
  * GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps have automated language detection, instead, BitBucket requires users to set up the language in their repositories.
* SCM Topic:
  * This applies to GitHub and GitLab.
* Multiple different rules based on the words we found in the repositories:
  * This applies to GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, and BitBucket.

## **Developers**

You can see the list of all developers that worked on that specific asset. The details list includes the SCM profile details for code committers to the repository asset.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Asset devs- New UI.png" alt="AppRisk - Developers"><figcaption><p>AppRisk - Developers</p></figcaption></figure>

## **Class**

Reflects the business criticality of the asset from A (most critical) to D (least critical), as you defined it in the Policies view.

You can manually change the business criticality of an asset. Click the criticality level and select another one from the list.

After manually setting the value of a class, you have the option to lock the value to prevent any potential overriding by a policy that has the Set Asset Class as an action. You can lock the value from the general or summary views of an asset. You can unlock the class value at any time by clicking the lock icon. A popup is displayed, asking you for confirmation about unlocking the value.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Class - New UI.png" alt="Snyk AppRisk - Lock the value of a class"><figcaption><p>Snyk AppRisk - Lock the value of a class</p></figcaption></figure>

The Asset Class column is also available on the Insights UI for risk-based prioritization, and it has the same functionality as it does here. At the moment, the Asset Class column is available only for repository assets, and applicable only for Snyk Code.

{% hint style="info" %}
The synchronization between Asset Class and the Insights UI can take up to 3 hours.
{% endhint %}

The class value can be auto-generated with policies. You just need to create a policy that has as an action **Set Asset Class**.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Class2 - New UI.png" alt="AppRisk - Class"><figcaption><p>Snyk AppRisk - Class</p></figcaption></figure>

## Source

The Source column in Snyk AppRisk helps users identify the origin of their assets, which can be directly from Snyk, through SCM systems, or using third-party integrations. This feature simplifies asset management and risk prioritization by providing clear visibility into the origin of each asset and it enables more effective security strategies and remediation efforts.

## SCM Repository freshness

The SCM Repository freshness column provides you with an immediate understanding of the current status of your repositories, including the date of the last commit. This assists you in quickly identifying active and dormant Projects and helps you with the decision-making regarding maintenance, security patching, and resource allocation.\\
