# License policy results

A newly assigned policy, or modifications to a policy, will apply after the next scheduled test runs for all of the licenses in the Organization.

If you change severity, results from scans are updated in the [Snyk Web UI](../../../getting-started/snyk-web-ui.md), in [your IDE](../../../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-workflow-and-integrations/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions/), or in Snyk [PR Checks](../../../scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/pull-request-checks/).

Examples of results follow.

In the Snyk Web UI, **Dashboard** statistics are updated based on severity changes:
