# Revoking and regenerating Snyk API tokens

{% hint style="info" %}
When an API token is revoked, all integrations using that key immediately stop working. Proceed with caution!
{% endhint %}

If you suspect an API token has been leaked, it is good practice to revoke that token and generate a new one to use in its place.

To revoke your Snyk user API token, navigate to your User Account Settings in the Snyk Web UI at [app.snyk.io/account](https://app.snyk.io/account).

Click the **Revoke & Regenerate** button to revoke your API token. A new one will be generated in its place. You can now copy the newly generated API token and update integrations that used the old key.
