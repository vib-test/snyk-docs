# Authenticating

To use the Snyk API, you must get your API token from Snyk. You can find your token in your [General Account Settings](https://app.snyk.io/account) after you register with Snyk and log in.

When using the API directly, provide the API token in an `Authorization` header, in the following example request, replacing `API_TOKEN` with your API Token

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.snyk.com/rest/self?version=2024-06-10" \
--header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
--header "Authorization: token API_TOKEN"
```

If you are using the API through [Snyk Apps](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api/snyk-apps), provide the `access_token` in an `Authorization` header preceded by `bearer` as follows:

```
Authorization: bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Otherwise, a `401 Unauthorized` response will be returned:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

{
    "status": "401",
    "code": "Unauthorized"
}
```
