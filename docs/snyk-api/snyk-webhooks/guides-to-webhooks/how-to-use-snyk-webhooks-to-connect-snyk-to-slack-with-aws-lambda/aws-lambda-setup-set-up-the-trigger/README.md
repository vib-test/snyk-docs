# AWS Lambda setup: expose a public URL

For Snyk to be able to send webhooks to the Lambda function you will need a public URL exposing the function. To do this you have two options, [API Gateway](with-api-gateway/) or a [Lambda function URL](with-a-lambda-function-url/). Choose the option that suits your current environments or needs the best.
