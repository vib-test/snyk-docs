If you would like to see the differences between two versions in the Snyk REST API, you can follow these steps:

1. In the [Snyk REST API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/) interface, navigate to the first version you want to compare and select **Download OpenAPI spec**.
2. Open another tab or window, and in the [Snyk REST API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/) interface, navigate to the second version you want to compare and select **Download OpenAPI spec**.
3. Open your preferred YAML file comparison tool (you can find one using a web search).
4. Paste the content of each YAML file into one of the comparison panels and select the compare option.

The differences are highlighted.
