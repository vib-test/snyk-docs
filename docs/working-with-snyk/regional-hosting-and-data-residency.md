# Regional hosting and data residency

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**

Regional hosting and data residency are available only for Enterprise plans.

For more information, see [Plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans).
{% endhint %}

Snyk can host your data in a number of regions. During initial onboarding of your system, you can work with your account team to select a multi-tenant region. For single-tenant availability (Snyk Private Cloud), reach out to your account team in advance of onboarding.

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, customers are hosted in the US region.
{% endhint %}

## **What is data residency?**

Data residency allows you to control the region in which Snyk hosts a selected subset of your data. For more information, see [Regional and global data](regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#regional-and-global-data).

Data residency is available for [Snyk Open Source](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-open-source/), [Snyk Code](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-code/), [Snyk Container](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/), and [Snyk IaC](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/).

## **How does data residency work?**

During your system onboarding, you can work with your account team to select a hosting region. When using Snyk features, you will use specific URLs that differ from the default US region URLs.

{% hint style="warning" %}
After you select a region, the data in that region cannot be migrated to another region. Moving to a new region requires a complete re-onboarding.
{% endhint %}

## **What regions are available?**

Snyk offers data residency for the following regions:

|          Region         |           URL          |
| :---------------------: | :--------------------: |
|      USA (default)      |   https://app.snyk.io  |
| EU (Germany, Frankfurt) | https://app.eu.snyk.io |
|     AUS (Australia)     | https://app.au.snyk.io |

Single-tenant deployments may support more regions than the ones listed here, subject to validation of architectural service supportability by Snyk engineering.

## Regional and global data

Snyk leverages a number of sub-processors to provide you with a high-quality service. Thus not all data types can be stored within your region of choice. The list of sub-processors is available [on the Snyk website](https://snyk.io/policies/subprocessors/).

See [How Snyk handles your data](how-snyk-handles-your-data.md) for product-specific examples of how this data is handled.

## Regional multi- and single-tenant hosting notes

Snyk offers almost all the same features, support, and performance in the regional multi- and single-tenant regions as in the US region. For an up-to-date overview of feature parity across regions, reach out to your account team.

#### **AU**

`SNYK_API=https://app.au.snyk.io/api`

When running Jenkins, use the additional argument:

`--API=https://app.eu.snyk.io/api`

#### **AU**

`--API=https://app.au.snyk.io/api`

### IDEs URLs

Snyk IDE extensions have modifiable options similar to the CLI and need to be configured to use the appropriate endpoint. In the extensions settings for Snyk in your IDE, set the **Custom Endpoint** parameter to the appropriate value for EU and AU as follows.

Set up your `values-customer-settings.yml` with the correct Broker Server URL for your region, based on the values found in the [Broker URLs](regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#broker-urls) instructions.

Then add an extra variable in the `values-customer-settings.yml`:
