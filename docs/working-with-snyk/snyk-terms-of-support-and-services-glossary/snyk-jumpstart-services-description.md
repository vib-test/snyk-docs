# Snyk Jumpstart Services Description

## Overview of Snyk Jumpstart

A Snyk Consultant will provide services to help the Customer accelerate the setup of Snyk products through assisted account configuration (the “Jumpstart Services”). The engagement will consist of knowledge transfer, paired with configuration guidance for your team.

The objective is a working setup of Snyk and a Customer team that is well-prepared to continue its application security efforts.

**Jumpstart is recommended for**:

* Teams needing assistance with the setup of Snyk products
* Teams who are new to Snyk and have limited experience with security scanning
* Self-starters who are comfortable with extending and maintaining Snyk on their own, post-engagement

## Jumpstart Services description

The Snyk Consultant will deliver the following services related to the setup of Snyk remotely as part of the Jumpstart Services to the Customer. Note that the Jumpstart Services will be delivered only for the Snyk Applications purchased on an Order Form at the same time as this service. References to Snyk Services not purchased by the Customer are hereby omitted unless otherwise noted.

## Pre-engagement planning and preparation

A **pre-engagement call** will be held before the start of the Jumpstart Services listed herein, to ensure the Customer understands the prerequisites required for engagement start along with the deliverables completed during the engagement timeframe. Customer [prerequisites](snyk-jumpstart-customer-prerequisites.md), including resources, availability, and deliverables for each product module, will be reviewed and confirmed. The Customer acknowledges that complying with these prerequisites is its sole responsibility, and Snyk will not be responsible for any delays or failure to deliver the Jumpstart Services based on the Customer’s failure to meet these prerequisites.
