# Implement Snyk

Implementing a developer security tool like Snyk is critical to ensuring the security of your applications, from development through deployment. Whatever the size of your team, the goals are to fix vulnerabilities and foster a culture of security awareness and responsibility across your entire business.

Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate your current security practices and identify areas for improvement.
2. **Planning**: use the provided project plans to outline your goals, timelines, and necessary resources.
3. **Configuration**: Follow configuration guidance to tailor the security platform to your needs, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with your existing tools and workflows.
4. **Rollout**: Implement the platform across your development teams, following the specific guidance for small teams or enterprise environments.
5. **Training**: Educate your developers on the importance of security and how to use the platform effectively.
6. **Monitoring and iteration**: Continuously monitor the health and performance of your applications and make adjustments as needed to maintain optimal security.

If you have a small team looking for guidance on rolling out Snyk within your processes, see the [Team implementation guide](team-implementation-guide/).

If you are part of an enterprise implementing a large-scale rollout, see the [Enterprise implementation guide](enterprise-implementation-guide/).

The guides include a downloadable project plan, a planning phase, configuration guidance, and guidance on rollout specific to each context.
