# Custom role templates

This section provides templates for custom roles, with their titles and corresponding permissions reflecting the key responsibilities of users throughout the development lifecycle while using Snyk.

These templates are not provided as[ pre-defined roles](../pre-defined-roles.md) in Snyk. For detailed information on how to create and manage custom roles, see [Manage user roles](../user-role-management.md).

You can use these templates to create your own custom roles that fit into and reflect your business structure.
