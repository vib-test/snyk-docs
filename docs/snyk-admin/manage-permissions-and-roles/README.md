# User roles

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**

The Snyk free subscription plan allows you to send up to 200 pending invitations every seven days and has only administrator roles.

Enterprise plans have administrators, viewers, collaborators, and custom roles.

For more information, see [Plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans).

Permissions are granted to users according to their role.

Snyk Enterprise plan customers can [manage user roles](user-role-management.md), [change the role of a user](user-role-management.md#change-the-role-of-a-user) in the Snyk Web UI, or [update member roles using the Snyk API v1](../user-management-with-the-snyk-api/update-member-roles-using-the-v1-api.md).

When you create or edit a role, as explained on the [User role management](user-role-management.md) page, the Web UI displays a list of permissions you can associate with each role. For more information, see [Pre-defined user roles](pre-defined-roles.md).

There are many considerations involved in managing user roles. See these sections on the [User role management](user-role-management.md) page:

* [Permissions (role) required to edit Project attributes from the Snyk CLI](user-role-management.md#permissions-role-required-to-edit-project-attributes-from-the-snyk-cli)
* [Essential information for working with Member roles](user-role-management.md#essential-information-for-working-with-member-roles)
