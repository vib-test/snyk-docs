# Groups

{% hint style="warning" %}

This feature is available with Enterprise Plans. See [Plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/) for details.

Snyk Groups make it easier for you to work in teams. Groups can contain many Organizations, and each Organization can contain many collaborators and Projects.

As part of your onboarding, Snyk will set you up with a Group for your company. You can then add your current Organizations to this Group. If you think your company will need multiple Groups, submit a request to [Snyk Support](https://snyk.zendesk.com/agent/dashboard). See [Structure your account for high application performance](../../structure-your-account-for-high-application-performance.md) for details concerning multiple Groups.

## Group-level options

You can use Group-level options to view [Organizations](./#group-organizations), [reports](./#group-reports), [dependencies](./#group-dependencies), and [policies](./#group-policies) across all of the Organizations in your Group, configure your [Group settings](./#group-settings), and view all the [users](./#group-members) in a Group.
