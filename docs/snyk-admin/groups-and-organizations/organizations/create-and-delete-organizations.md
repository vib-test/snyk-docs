A new Organization is created and is added to your Organizations list.

By default, each Organization has a unique Snyk ID and internal name, which you can find on the **Settings** page of the Organization.

Review the settings and integrations for the new Organization and adjust them to meet your requirements before importing Projects to the new Organization.

## Delete an Organization

Organization Admins can delete Organizations when there are no Groups. If the Organization is in a Group, only a Group Admin can delete the Organization.

Follow these steps to delete an Organization:

1\. On the Snyk Web UI, open the Organization dropdown list on the top menu and select the Organization you want to delete.

2\. After the selected Organization appears, click the **Org Settings** button on the Group menu.

3\. On the **Settings** page, select **Genera**l on the menu.

4\. Scroll down to the **Delete organization** section and click the **Delete organization** button:
